.gitignore


Perfect — they’re assigning an exercise where you intentionally create merge conflicts by pushing your feature branch into a friend’s feature branch, then resolve those conflicts.

Here’s how you can proceed confidently and guide the group if needed:

Pull your friend’s branch:

git checkout feature-friendname
git pull origin feature-friendname
Merge your branch into theirs:

git merge feature-yourname
This will trigger merge conflicts if both branches modified the same lines.

Resolve conflicts: Open the conflicted files, look for markers like

<<<<<<< HEAD
your friend’s code
=======
your code
>>>>>>> feature-yourname
Decide which changes to keep or combine, then save and stage them:

git add .
git commit
Push the resolved branch:

git push origin feature-friendname
You can summarize to the instructor:
“Got it — I’ll merge my feature branch into my friend’s branch, resolve any conflicts manually, commit the resolution, and push the updated branch back.”

That shows you fully understand branching, merging, and conflict resolution workflows.
